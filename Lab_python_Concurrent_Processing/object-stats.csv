"Example of type of protective glove worn by operators of x-ray eq. lead lined gloves, aprons & face shields were some of the earliest & simplest protective devices used: screening stands and couches, and lead glass viewing windows were also employed. the effect of x-rays on both operators and patients was not well understood for many years, but by 1928 minimum lead values for gloves, etc. had been established.",1
